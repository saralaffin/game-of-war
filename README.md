# game-of-war
Project 2 in General Assembly SEI35 in Washington, DC. Given the requirements below by GA.

## Requirements
To play, each player reveals the top card in their stack. The player who played the card with the higher rank (Aces high) takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of their stack in an arbitrary order.

If there is a tie, then it's War! In the card game each player adds places the top three cards of their stack face down, and then each player reveals the top card again. Whoever wins out of the second reveal takes all of the cards, and if there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

### Technical Requirements
For this project, we'd like you to make it so we can play the game through the console in the browser. You'll therefore need an index.html file that includes the scripts for your game.

Additionally, your project should meet the following requirements:

* Your game should run without errors
* The game should start when the player loads the page. Create your two players and start the rounds!
* Print a message for each "round" of the game showing the cards played by each user, who won the round, and how many cards each player now has.
* Include a README written in well formatted Markdown (hint: look up README templates)
* Show a good commit history with frequent commits (We're looking for lots of small commits)
